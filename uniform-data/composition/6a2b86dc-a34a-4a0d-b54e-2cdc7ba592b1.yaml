                                When you first get your driver's license, your
                                lack of experience creates more expensive car
                                insurance premiums. Inexperienced drivers are
                                historically more likely to get involved in an
                                accident and file an insurance claim. Because of
                                this, insurance companies charge more for an
                                inexperienced driver's car insurance policy than
                                they do for more experienced operators.
                                Insurance is a business that assesses risk to
                                offer car insurance, and if you pose a bigger
                                risk than someone else, you are charged a higher
                                insurance premium. In addition to your lack of
                                experience, if you apply for your first car
                                insurance policy, you will incur an additional
                                surcharge for not having prior insurance. Even
                                though your first car insurance policy may cost
                                you more than you expect, there are ways to find
                                affordable car insurance no matter what kind of
                                driver you are.

                                , it may be best to talk to your parents about
                                being added to their current insurance policy.
                                In doing this, you will typically find your car
                                insurance premium is less than if you were to
                                purchase your own car insurance policy. When you
                                are added to your parents' insurance policy, you
                                benefit from the lower rates they are receiving
                                for being more experienced drivers and discounts
                                they may have, such as multi-car, tenure
                                credits, and possibly a homeownership or
                                bundling discount. If you purchase your own auto
                                insurance policy, you will find your insurance
                                costs are higher because you will be charged for
                                your lack of experience and prior insurance.

                                driver. Many insurance companies offer all types

                                you get all of the car insurance discounts you

                                It is important to ask your insurance agent or
                                company about all of the available discounts on
                                your auto insurance policy so that you can
                                ensure that you're getting affordable car
                                insurance without compromising your coverage.
