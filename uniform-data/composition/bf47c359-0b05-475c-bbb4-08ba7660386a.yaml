                          This coverage will respond to injuries that you or
                          your passengers incur in an accident that is not your
                          fault with an uninsured driver or a driver that does
                          not have enough bodily injury liability coverage to
                          cover the extent of your and your passengers' injuries
                          in an accident. It helps cover medical expenses, lost
                          wages, and other related costs.

                          If your car is damaged in an accident, or stolen,
                          vandalized, or damaged by fire or weather, the
                          collision and comprehensive coverages on your policy
                          will pay to repair or replace your vehicle if you have
                          elected to carry these coverages. Each of these
                          coverages has a deductible that you will need to be
                          prepared to pay out-of-pocket before your insurance
                          company responds to the claim.

                          This type of coverage helps pay for damage you cause
                          to someone else's vehicle or property in an accident.
                          It can include things like cars, fences, buildings, or
                          utility poles. It also covers legal defense costs if
                          you're sued, up to the limits of your policy. Most
                          states require this coverage as part of a minimum auto
                          insurance policy.
