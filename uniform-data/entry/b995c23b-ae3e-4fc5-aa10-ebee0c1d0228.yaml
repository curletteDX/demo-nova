                    Borrowing a friend’s car can be convenient, but it also
                    raises important questions about insurance coverage.
                    Understanding how insurance works in these situations can
                    help you avoid unexpected costs and complications. This
                    comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about
                    insurance when driving a friend’s car, including permissive
                    use, when the owner’s insurance applies, when you might need
                    your own coverage, what happens if you’re in an accident,
                    non-owner car insurance, and tips for borrowing cars safely.

                    Driving a friend’s car can be straightforward if you
                    understand how insurance works. The owner’s policy usually
                    provides primary coverage, but there are exceptions and
                    limitations. Always communicate with the car owner, check
                    the insurance details, and consider your own coverage needs.
                    By following these guidelines, you can borrow a car with
                    confidence and peace of mind.
