                    Whether you’re storing a classic car for the winter, keeping
                    a vehicle off the road during a long trip, or simply have a
                    car you don’t drive often, understanding your insurance
                    options is crucial. This guide covers everything you need to
                    know about insuring a car in storage, including legal
                    requirements, risks, coverage options, and best practices.

                    In most states and provinces, vehicles that are registered
                    and have license plates must carry at least the minimum
                    required liability insurance—even if they’re not being
                    driven. However, if you officially declare your car as “off
                    the road” (sometimes called a Statutory Off Road
                    Notification or SORN in the UK), you may be able to cancel
                    your liability insurance. Always check your local laws, as
                    requirements vary by region. Failing to maintain required
                    insurance can result in fines, penalties, or even suspension
                    of your vehicle registration.

                    While it might be tempting to cancel your insurance to save
                    money while your car is in storage, doing so exposes you to
                    several risks:

                    Many insurers offer a “comprehensive-only” or “storage”
                    insurance policy for vehicles that won’t be driven for an
                    extended period. This type of coverage protects your car
                    against non-collision risks, such as:

                    Comprehensive-only coverage is typically much less expensive
                    than a standard policy with liability and collision
                    coverage, since the risk of an accident is eliminated while
                    the car is off the road.

                    Properly insuring a car in storage protects your investment
                    and gives you peace of mind. By understanding your legal
                    obligations, the risks of canceling coverage, and the
                    benefits of comprehensive-only insurance, you can make the
                    best decision for your situation. Always consult your
                    insurance provider and local authorities to ensure you’re
                    fully compliant and protected while your vehicle is off the
                    road.
