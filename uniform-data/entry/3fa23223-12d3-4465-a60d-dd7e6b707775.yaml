                    With the rise of flexible work arrangements and changing
                    lifestyles, more people are driving less than ever before.
                    If you only use your car occasionally, you may be considered
                    a part-time driver—and that can have a significant impact on
                    your car insurance options and costs. This article explores
                    everything you need to know about insurance for part-time
                    drivers, including who qualifies, available insurance
                    options, how pay-per-mile works, low-mileage discount
                    programs, coverage considerations, and the best situations
                    for part-time coverage.

                    If your driving habits change—such as returning to a daily
                    commute—be sure to update your insurer to avoid coverage
                    gaps or policy violations.

                    Insurance for part-time drivers can offer significant
                    savings and flexibility. By understanding your driving
                    habits and exploring options like pay-per-mile insurance or
                    low-mileage discounts, you can find a policy that fits your
                    needs and budget. Always compare quotes, ask about available
                    discounts, and ensure you maintain the coverage required by
                    law and your personal circumstances.
