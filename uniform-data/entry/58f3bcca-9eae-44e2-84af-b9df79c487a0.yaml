                    Owning a car that spends more time parked than on the road
                    might make you question the need for traditional auto
                    insurance. However, even rarely-driven vehicles require the
                    right coverage to protect your investment and comply with
                    legal requirements. Fortunately, there are insurance options
                    tailored for low-mileage drivers that can help you save
                    money while staying protected. In this article, we’ll
                    explore why insurance is still necessary, the types of
                    low-mileage insurance programs available, and how to choose
                    the best option for your situation.

                    Before choosing a policy, compare quotes from multiple
                    insurers and ask about low-mileage, pay-per-mile, or
                    usage-based programs. Be honest about your driving habits to
                    ensure you get the best rate and maintain the coverage you
                    need.

                    Even if your car spends most of its time parked, insurance
                    is still a necessity. By exploring low-mileage discounts,
                    pay-per-mile policies, and usage-based programs, you can
                    find coverage that fits your needs and budget. Always review
                    your policy annually and update your insurer if your driving
                    habits change to maximize your savings and protection.
